# Public Notes

This is my personal, public notes collection. It includes collections for links, recipes, tools, and other things I think are valuable to share with others.

It's also a place for public ideas, thoughts, and experiments. If you find something useful here, feel free to explore, reuse, or build on it.

## Obsidian Vault

This repository is an Obsidian vault. You can clone it and open the folder in Obsidian to browse the notes locally.

Contributions are welcome. If you'd like to add something, improve a note, or fix an issue, please open a pull request.
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## Installation / Setup

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/public-notes.git
```

3. Open Obsidian.
4. Choose `Open folder as vault` and select the cloned `public-notes` folder.

## Git Sync For Forks (Obsidian Git)

If you want easy two-way sync with your fork, you can use the Obsidian Git community plugin.

1. In Obsidian, go to `Settings` → `Community plugins` → enable community plugins.
2. Browse and install `Obsidian Git`.
3. In the plugin settings:
   - Set the vault repo to your fork (the cloned folder).
   - Configure an auto pull on startup and auto push on a timer if you want hands-off sync.
4. Use the command palette to run `Git: Pull` and `Git: Push` as needed.

Note: You will need Git installed on your machine and authenticated to GitHub for pushing to your fork.
